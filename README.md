NigeriaMRS_HTML_DCTs

The HTML Form Entry allows anyone with basic HTML programming skills and a knowledge of the OpenMRS system to create forms. It is an alternative to the Infopath Form Entry module in many (but not all) cases.

The key point about writing forms with this module is that you only have to write HTML (with some special tags for things in the OpenMRS model) and the module will automatically "just know" what to do when the user clicks the submit button. Currently a form submission creates one encounter for one patient.

NOTE: All the NigeriaMRS_HTML_DCTs shared here are from the original NigeriaMRS core codes implemented by partners, we didnâ€™t alter or create additional concept(s) on our current NigeriaMRS distribution. These codes were rearranged for better end user experience.
